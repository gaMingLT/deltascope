This repo is made for my Bachelor Thesis of 2023 at Howest Bruges. The application performs Delta Baselining when two raw disk images (states) are entered as input.

More information can be found in the accompanying thesis explaining ``Delta Baselining: File System`` concept & the application [here - ADD LINK]().

## Description

The application uses the ``fls``, ``mactime`` and ``grep`` utilities under the hood to perform Delta Baselining on the file system when two states (raw disk images) are provided as input.

## Architecture

The application consists of three components: api ``fastapi``, web ``NextJS``, cli ``python``.

## Running the application

**TODO add guide as much as possible**

## Problems

**TODO: add list of problems**
